This directory holds folders for the source experiments (each subfolder contains its own Makefile), 
the header files to include for CARSS clients, the compiled shared object libraries to load at runtime, and the Python interface files.

The compiled 'mid' executable is for the middleware server. All precompiled libraries and executables were compiled on an x86 Unix machine.
Note: there are no dependencies of the CARSS system on CUDA or OpenGL of any sort.

The full source code may be provided conditioned upon successful publication of accompanying work, and remains at the discretion 
of the authors and stakeholders.
